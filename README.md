## 👋 Hi, I'm Michal Pietrus


Independent researcher and engineer working at the intersection of cryptography, digital identity, trust protocols, 
and distributed systems. I focus on practical mechanisms for verifiable trust distribution, secure key management, and identity protocols.


### 🔐 Focus Areas

- Decentralized trust systems — the KERI Suite: KERI, ACDC, CESR, and relatives  
- Cryptographic protocol design — HPKE, Noise, PKI interoperability  
- Post-quantum transition — to-PQC-or-not-to-PQC

### 🧩 Contributions
Maintainer and contributor in the Human Colossus Foundation ecosystem: OCA, DKMS (Rust implementation of KERI protocol).

### 🧠 Current Exploration
Drone ID interoperability (DIDI) and verifiable trust primitives for UAVs.

### 💬 Collaboration

If your project touches cryptography, distributed trust, or post-quantum migration —  
I'm open to collaboration, reviews, or short-term research contributions.
